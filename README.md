# Weather

A weather app building upon Angular 5 and Bootstrap 4.

This is a work in progress. Se current production build at [here](https://mattssonj.github.io/TheWeatherApp/search)

For the time being, the app collects data from OpenWeatherMap.
Back end will be developed later on.

See my current plans about the project [here](https://github.com/mattssonj/TheWeatherApp/projects/1)
